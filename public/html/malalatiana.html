            My name is Malalatiana. I am a senior who is majoring in computer graphics and imaging. After learning about 3d modeling through my courses for my major, I gained interest in 3d modeling and
           would like to become a 3d artist. I am also interested in photography, 2d art, design, etc. My hobbies are playing volleyball, tennis and listening to music. I am currently learning Japanese
           and would like learn a lot of other languages in the future.
